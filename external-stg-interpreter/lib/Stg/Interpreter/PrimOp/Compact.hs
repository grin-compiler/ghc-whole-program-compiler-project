        {Primitives for working with compact regions. The {\tt ghc\-compact}
         library and the {\tt compact} library demonstrate how to use these
         primitives. The documentation below draws a distinction between
         a CNF and a compact block. A CNF contains one or more compact
         blocks. The source file {\tt rts\/sm\/CNF.c}
         diagrams this relationship. When discussing a compact
         block, an additional distinction is drawn between capacity and
         utilized bytes. The capacity is the maximum number of bytes that
         the compact block can hold. The utilized bytes is the number of
         bytes that are actually used by the compact block.

     the capacity of the compact block (in bytes, not words).

     and is capped to one mega block. }

     determines the capacity of each compact block in the CNF. It
     does not retroactively affect existing compact blocks in the CNF. }

     bytes) given by the first argument. The {\texttt Addr\#} is a pointer
     to previous compact block of the CNF or {\texttt nullAddr\#} to create a
     new CNF with a single compact block.

     The resulting block is not known to the GC until
     {\texttt compactFixupPointers\#} is called on it, and care must be taken

     the internal pointers inside the CNF to account for
     a different position in memory than when it was serialized.
     This method must be called exactly once after importing

     at the same time. Note: {\texttt compactAdd\#} is not thread-safe, so
     only one thread may call {\texttt compactAdd\#} with a particular
     {\texttt Compact\#} at any given time. The primop does not
