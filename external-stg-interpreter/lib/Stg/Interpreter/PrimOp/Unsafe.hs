-- Note [reallyUnsafePtrEquality#]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--
-- reallyUnsafePtrEquality# can't actually fail, per se, but we mark it can_fail
-- anyway. Until 5a9a1738023a, GHC considered primops okay for speculation only
-- when their arguments were known to be forced. This was unnecessarily
-- conservative, but it prevented reallyUnsafePtrEquality# from floating out of
-- places where its arguments were known to be forced. Unfortunately, GHC could
-- sometimes lose track of whether those arguments were forced, leading to let/app
-- invariant failures (see #13027 and the discussion in #11444). Now that
-- ok_for_speculation skips over lifted arguments, we need to explicitly prevent
-- reallyUnsafePtrEquality# from floating out. Imagine if we had
--
--     \x y . case x of x'
--              DEFAULT ->
--            case y of y'
--              DEFAULT ->
--               let eq = reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x' y'
--               in ...
--
-- If the let floats out, we'll get
--
--     \x y . let eq = reallyUnsafePtrEquality# x y
--            in case x of ...
--
-- The trouble is that pointer equality between thunks is very different
-- from pointer equality between the values those thunks reduce to, and the latter
-- is typically much more precise.
