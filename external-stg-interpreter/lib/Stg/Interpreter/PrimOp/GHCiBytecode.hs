        linker.

        Bytecode objects are heap objects which represent top-level bindings and
        contain a list of instructions and data needed by these instructions.}

   { Retrieve the address of any Haskell value. This is
     essentially an {\texttt unsafeCoerce\#}, but if implemented as such
     the core lint pass complains and fails to compile.
     As a primop, it is opaque to core/stg, and only appears
     in cmm (where the copy propagation pass will get rid of it).
     Note that "a" must be a value, not a thunk! It's too late
     for strictness analysis to enforce this, so you're on your
     own to guarantee this. Also note that {\texttt Addr\#} is not a GC
     pointer - up to you to guarantee that it does not become
     a dangling pointer immediately after you get it.}
